Contributing
============
If you would like to contribute cheetsheets or program functionality, please
fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Python code should conform to [PEP 8][].

Licensing
---------
By contributing to the project, you agree to license your work under the same
licenses as `cheat` itself. `cheat` is currently dual-licensed under the GPL3
and MIT licenses, though that could change without notice in the future.

`cheat`, however, will always remain free software (as in both "free as in
freedom" and "free as in beer") and shall always be licensed accordingly.
