# Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application
eb init

### Deploying two different environments inside the same Elastic Beanstalk Application
# Once the beanstalk Application has been created, you can do the following

# Switching and deploying to staging
eb use helloeb-staging
eb deploy

# Switching and deploying to production
eb use helloeb-production
eb deploy

## Create a staging credential profile
aws configure --profile staging

## Create a production credential profile
aws configure --profile production

## Using existing profile in .aws/config and .aws/credentials, you can run the following
## command to switch to the application and environment
## This will prompts for region and environment, if credentials are already setup
eb init helloeb --profile staging
