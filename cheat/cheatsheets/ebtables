# NOTEs for ebtables
# 

# If the ebtables command is available then you can view the rulebase using the -L option. For example, for the filter table
ebtables -t filter -L

# If the rulebase is non-empty then you can obtain some insight into what effect it might be having by inspecting the counters associated with each rule
ebtables -t filter -L --Lc
