# Running command on multiple hosts
fab --password=$PW -P -H host1,host2 -- hostname 

# With large host lists, a userâ€™s local machine can get overwhelmed by running too many
# concurrent Fabric processes. Because of this, you may opt to use a moving bubble
# approach that limits Fabric to a specific number of concurrently active processes.
# This is useful for large amount of hosts
fab --password=$PW -P -z 10 -H host1,host2 -- hostname
