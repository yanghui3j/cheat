# Use the following command to view the SELinux context of files and directories, it shows user:role:type:level
ls -Z file1

#Run the following command as root to view a list of mappings between SELinux and Linux user
semanage login -l

# Use the ps -eZ command to view the SELinux context for processes
ps -eZ

# Use the following command to view the SELinux context associated with your Linux user
id -Z

# Confirm that SELinux is enabled
sestatus

# The chcon command relabels files; however, such label changes do not survive when the file system is relabeled. For permanent changes that survive a file system relabel, use the semanage utility
chcon -t samba_share_t /var/www/html/testfile

#If the auditd daemon is running, an error similar to the following is logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log
cat /var/log/audit/audit.log

# To make the httpd process run unconfined, run the following command as root to change the type of the /usr/sbin/httpd file, to a type that does not transition to a confined domain
chcon -t unconfined_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd

# The restorecon utility restores the default SELinux context for files. As root, run the following command to restore the default SELinux context for /usr/sbin/httpd
restorecon -v /usr/sbin/httpd

# The getenforce command returns the status of SELinux
getenforce

# The following command to confirm that SELinux did not deny actions during the last boot. If SELinux did not deny actions during the last boot, this command does not return any output.
grep "SELinux is preventing" /var/log/messages

# Listing Booleans
semanage boolean -l

# The getsebool -a command lists Booleans, whether they are on or off, but does not give a description of each one. The following example does not list all Booleans 
getsebool -a

# Run the getsebool boolean-name command to only list the status of the boolean-name Boolean
getsebool cvs_read_shadow

# Use a space-separated list to list multiple Booleans
getsebool cvs_read_shadow daemons_dump_core ftp_home_dir

# To temporarily enable Apache HTTP Server scripts and modules to connect to database servers, run the following command as root
setsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db on

# This change is not persistent across reboots. To make changes persistent across reboots, run the setsebool -P boolean-name on command as root
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on

# Run the following command, remembering to use the full path to the file or directory
semanage fcontext -a options file-name|directory-name

# Use the restorecon utility to apply the context changes
restorecon -v file-name|directory-name

# As root, run the following command to change the file1 type to samba_share_t. The -a option adds a new record, and the -t option defines a type (samba_share_t). Note that running this command does not directly change the type; file1 is still labeled with the etc_t type, it adds lines to /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local
semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t /etc/file1

# As root, use the restorecon utility to change the type. Because semanage added an entry to file.contexts.local for /etc/file1, restorecon changes the type to samba_share_t
restorecon -v /etc/file1

# adding and removing an SELinux context with -->  semanage fcontext -d file-name|directory-name
semanage fcontext -d /test
restorecon -R -v /test

# The following example mounts an NFS volume so that it can be shared via the Apache HTTP Server
mount server:/export /local/mount/point -o context="system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0"

# Chaning the default context
mount /dev/sda2 /test/ -o defcontext="system_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0"

# To mount multiple mounts from a single NFS export, with each mount having a different context, use the -o nosharecache,context options. The following example mounts multiple mounts from a single NFS export, with a different context for each mount (allowing a single service access to each one) 
mount server:/export/web /local/web -o nosharecache,context="system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0"
mount server:/export/database /local/database -o nosharecache,context="system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0"

# The following example adds an entry to /etc/fstab for an NFS context mount
server:/export /local/mount/ nfs context="system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0" 0 0

# Using the --preserve=context option preserves SELinux contexts during copy operations. As shown below, the user_home_t type of file1 was preserved when the file was copied to /var/www/html/
cp --preserve=context file1 /var/www/html/

# Use the --context option to define the SELinux context
cp --context=system_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0 file1 file2

#The matchpathcon -V option compares the current SELinux context to the correct, default context in SELinux policy. Run the following command to check all files in the /var/www/html/ directory
matchpathcon -V /var/www/html/*

# Use the tar --selinux command to create archives that retain contexts
tar --selinux -cf test.tar file{1,2,3}

# Use the star -xattr -H=exustar command to create archives that retain contexts
star -xattr -H=exustar -c -f=test.star file{1,2,3}

# This command provides a short output of the access vector cache statistics since boot
avcstat

# This utility is useful in describing the break-down of a policy, such as the number of classes, types, Booleans, allow rules, and others 
seinfo

# The seinfo utility can also list the number of types with the domain attribute, giving an estimate of the number of different confined processes
seinfo -adomain -x | wc -l

# To look at the number of unconfined domains, use the unconfined_domain attribute 
seinfo -aunconfined_domain_type -x | wc -l

# Permissive domains can be counted with the --permissive option
seinfo --permissive -x | wc -l

# You can use the sesearch utility to search for a particular rule in the policy. It is possible to search either policy source files or the binary file
sesearch --role_allow -t httpd_sys_content_t /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.24

# The sesearch utility can provide the number of allow rules
sesearch --allow | wc -l

# The number of dontaudit rules
sesearch --dontaudit | wc -l

# As root, create a new Linux user (useruuser) that is mapped to the SELinux user_u user
useradd -Z user_u useruuser

# To map the Linux newuser user to the SELinux user_u user, run the following command as root
semanage login -a -s user_u newuser

# As root, remove the mapping between the Linux newuser user and user_u
semanage login -d newuser

# run the following command as root to change the default mapping from unconfined_u to user_u
semanage login -m -S targeted -s "user_u" -r s0 __default__

# To change back to the default behavior, run the following command as root to map the __default__ login to the SELinux unconfined_u user 
semanage login -m -S targeted -s "unconfined_u" -r s0-s0:c0.c1023 __default__


# Example 01: mysqld
semanage port -a -t mysqld_port_t -p tcp 3306
semanage fcontext -a -t mysqld_db_t "/datadir(/.*)?"
restorecon -Rv /datadir

# Example add port for httpd
semanage port -l|grep http #查看SELinux下http相关端口
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 888 #增加这个非标准端口即可
[root@localhost ~]# /etc/init.d/httpd restart 或者 service httpd start
